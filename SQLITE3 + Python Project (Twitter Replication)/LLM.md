This SQL query retrieves the latest tweets and retweets from users that the current user follows. It does this in two main steps:
1. It first combines tweets and retweets from followed users into a single table.
2. Then, it selects distinct entries from this combined table, ensuring only the latest tweet or retweet from each user is included.
The result is a list of unique tweet IDs, their authors, the dates they were posted, and whether they are original tweets or retweets, sorted by date in descending order. The ? in the query is a placeholder for the current userâ€™s ID. This query helps in displaying the most recent activity from the users that the current user follows.
